## Mathematics

* Sieve of Eratosthenes is used to determine if n is a prime number.
* Inface in doing so, it can generate a range of numbers till n, telling which is prime & which is not.


## Probability

* This can be a complex topic, but it's based in a few basic laws that can be logically derived.

* Bayes' Theorem => P( A given B ) = P( B given A ) P (A) / P (B)

* Independence => If A & B are independent that means happening of A doesn't indicate anything about happening of B
P( A and B ) = P(A) * P(B)

* Mutually Exclusive => Two events are said to be Mutually Exclusive if one happens then the other can not happen.
P( A or B ) = P(A) + P(B)
