__graphs__

* prioritizing adjacency list over adjacency matrix for implementations.

* including sample graph datasets for list & matrix both.

__tips__

* visited lookup is not required for a Directed Acyclic Graph.

* ALthough, cyclic graph, it becomes necessary to use the visited lookup while traversing graph.

* for finding nodes or gathering shortest distances, it is beneficial to use BFS over DFS.
