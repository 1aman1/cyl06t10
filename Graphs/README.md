__graphs__

* prioritizing adjacency list over adjacency matrix for implementations.

* including sample graph datasets for list & matrix both.

__tips__

* visited lookup is not required for a Directed Acyclic Graph.

* ALthough, wheneer there is a loop in the graph, it becomess necessary to use the visited lookup while traversing graph.
